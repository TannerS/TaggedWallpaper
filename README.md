# Smart Wallpaper!

Smart Wallpaper is an app focuses on supplying the user with high-def. photos to be used as wallpaper for their personal smart device! Smart Wallpaper comes with a simple UI to make navigating the photos easier for the average user. As an added bonus, have you ever thought of what related photos may go with a photo of your choosing? Well with Clarifai technology, any image can be searched for related tags and then searched against the Flickr.com database where all images are pulled from!

## Disclaimer

Images are pulled off Flickr.com. This app is made to pull images off specific “safe” photo groups instead of the general pool of public photos. This way it can help prevent / minimize mature-rated photos. This also means that photo searches are based off a photo group instead of all the possible photos; this means there is limited amounts of tags that can be searched.

Everything here is based on tags, so when searching for images be sure to “think like a tag” and be aware of spaces. E.g. searching “star wars” is not recommended over searching “starwars” due to the nature of the tagging system on Flickr.com.

One section of this app uses Clarifai which uses image recognition to identify tags based off photos you can select. These tags may or may not be correct due to the capabilities of the Clarifai service. Since any tags can occur after the image recognition is complete, there is no guarantee there will be any search results due to our attempt to block mature-rated photos.
